        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>Recipe can also make 4 individual tarts - adjust baking time for the crusts and filled tarts. (Check crusts after 8 minutes and tarts after 12).</p>
        <p>The lemon peel gives the tart a kick, but if you don't want it in your tart, add the peel and strain it out.</p>
        <p>I like to refrigerate mine when they have cooled.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon peel</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Combine butter with 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar in a bowl until smooth; stir in 1 cup flour. Press dough into prepared baking pan; pierce crust with fork in several places to prevent crust from puffing up during baking.</li>
            <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven until slightly golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk white sugar and eggs in a bowl; stir 3 tablespoons flour into mixture and add lemon juice, lemon peel, and salt. Whisk until thoroughly combined. Pour mixture into baked tart crust.</li>
            <li>Bake until filling is set, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool and dust with 3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar.</li>
        </ol>
