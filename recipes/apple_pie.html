        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my mother's apple pie. This is the recipe I use all the time and I love it. I also use a dash of nutmeg so if you wish you can put that in too.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 cups thinly sliced apples</li>
                <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch double-crust pie</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your pastry for a two crust pie. Wipe, quarter, core, peel, and slice apples; measure to 6 cups.</li>
                <li>Combine sugar and cinnamon. The amount of sugar used depends on how tart your apples are.</li>
                <li>Arrange apples in layers in pastry lined pie plate. Sprinkle each layer with sugar and cinnamon. Dot top layer with small pieces of butter or margarine. Cover with top crust.</li>
                <li>Place on lowest rack in oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes longer. Serve warm or cold.</li>
            </ol>
